During film production, selecting an adequate colour palette and scene dynamism is crucial for creating a visual impact on the audience. However, the influence of visual aesthetics, such as colour and scene dynamism on visual fatigue remains unexplored. In the present study, visual fatigue was assessed and compared in 30 young participants after viewing two popular films: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, an active, fast-paced film, and My Neighbour Totoro, a more relaxed film. Both films were viewed twice, once with the original colour palette and once in greyscale. Watching Spider-Man film induced a greater degree of visual fatigue than My Neighbour Totoro in two subjective questionnaires evaluating visual fatigue, and in the vergence facility and binocular accommodative facility tests. Moreover, important differences in the visual dynamics and colour aspects between both films were found. These results demonstrate that the high-paced and high-colour aspects of films directly affect visual fatigue. Future animated film producers should consider these factors that are relevant to their audiences."

However, there is no specific treatment for the envenomation caused by these species, which, while native to India and Sri Lanka, are widely distributed worldwide. The present study reports the case of a 31-year-old man bitten by a Poecilotheria regalis specimen. The patient's clinical presentation was similar to Latrodectus envenomation, and patient was treated with an L. mactans antivenom. Most of patient's symptoms improved (fasciculations, pain, erythema, and local swelling), except muscle cramps. A toxicological study conducted on mice did not show that L. mactans antivenom has a neutralizing effect on the toxicity of P. regalis. The present report discusses the envenoming process of Poecilotheria species and the possible neutralizing effect exerted by L. mactans antivenom."

Wang Xiaopo,Dermoscopic features of telangiectasia macularis multiplex acquisita.,"Telangiectasia macularis multiplex acquisita is a rarely described entity, characterized by multiple asymptomatic erythematous and/or brownish macules with telangiectasias, preferably on bilateral upper arms and trunk. We reported a 56-year-old Chinese man with telangiectasia macularis multiplex acquisita. Dermoscopic examination demonstrated an erythematous-brownish background with a striking angioid streak pattern (a central arteriole with superficial radiating small vessels attributed to spider-like eruptions) and linear-irregular branching vessels. We suggest dermoscopic features can be used to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and avoid unnecessary skin biopsies."

Epidemiological data from Brazil.,"The impact of Covid-19 on envenomations by venomous animals in countries heavily affected by both conditions has not been quantified yet. Brazil shows high incidence of envenomations by scorpions, spiders and snakes and was heavily affected by waves of Covid-19. To determine how the pandemic impacted the epidemiology of envenomations by those three groups of venomous animals, we used online databases from two surveillance sources on number of cases and mortality. During the years before and during the pandemic, scorpion stings typically occurred in adults of both sexes in urban zones in the Southeast and Northeast regions. Spider bites occurred mainly in the South region, in adults of both sexes in urban zone. Snakebites affected mainly rural adult men in the Amazon. Between 2007 and 2021, overall incidence of cases by scorpions, spiders and snakes decreased after the beginning of the pandemic, snakebites did not show changes after the pandemic started in Brazil, but cases by scorpions and spiders decreased. No changes in the incidence of deaths were observed. On national level, Covid-19 affected some demographic, clinical and epidemiological aspects in cases by scorpions, spiders and snakes."
"Tan Guohongfang, Jia Tianshuo, Qi Zhenzhen, Lu Shenzhou",Regenerated Fiber's Ideal Target: Comparable to Natural Fiber.,"The toughness of silk naturally obtained from spiders and silkworms exceeds that of all other natural and man-made fibers. These insects transform aqueous protein feedstocks into mechanically specialized materials, which represents an engineering phenomenon that has developed over millions of years of natural evolution. Silkworms have become a new research hotspot due to the difficulties in collecting spider silk and other challenges. According to continuous research on the natural spinning process of the silkworm, it is possible to divide the main aspects of bionic spinning into two main segments: the solvent and behavior. This work focuses on the various methods currently used for the spinning of artificial silk fibers to replicate natural silk fibers, providing new insights based on changes in the fiber properties and production processes over time."

One of the main web elements dissipating impact energy is the radial fibers, or major ampullate silks, which possess a toughness surpassing most man-made materials. Orb webs are extended phenotypes, and as such their architectural elements, including major ampullate silks, have been selected to optimize prey capture under the respective environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the correlation of three landscape scales and three microhabitat characteristics with intrinsic silk properties (elastic modulus, yield stress, tensile strength, extensibility, and toughness) to understand underlying ecological patterns. For this purpose, we collected and mechanically tested major ampullate silks from 50 spider species inhabiting large altitudinal and climatic gradients in Colombia. Using regression analysis and model selection, we investigated the environmental drivers of inter- and intra-specific patterns of major ampullate silk properties, taking into account phylogenetic relatedness based on newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes. We found that the total amount of energy absorbed, i.e., toughness and tensile strength, is higher for fibers from species inhabiting regions where heavy rainfall is common. Interestingly, we observe the same general trend between individuals of the same species, stressing the importance of this environmental driver. We also observe a phylogenetic conservation in the relation of environmental variables with silk tensile strength and yield stress. In conclusion, the increase in major ampullate silk tensile strength and toughness may reflect an adaptation to prevent frequent rain damage to orb webs and the associated energetic loss."

Severe systemic inflammation and single- and multiple-organ failure are a hallmark of this syndrome, with pro-inflammatory precipitating events occurring in the liver or extrahepatic regions. We report a case of a 69-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis who presented with a poorly defined, erythematous-purplish, and edematous plaque with multiple hemorrhagic blisters over the left leg, one day after receiving a spider bite. During the following hours, the skin lesion progressed, and the patient developed hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and arterial hypotension, requiring the administration of vasopressors; blood analysis revealed hypercreatininemia, an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) value, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic liver failure caused by cutaneous loxoscelism. There was no hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation in the patient, thus excluding the possibility of visceral loxoscelism."

This manuscript updates the epidemiological data of cases of human envenoming by spiders, scorpions, and insects with medical relevance in Brazil from 2010 to 2021. Epidemiological data were taken using the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System. Statistics of non-parametric data used the Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Nemenyi test. On average, more than 145,000 envenomation and 145 deaths are recorded annually, and more than 60% of deaths are caused by scorpion bites. When the number of deaths was pondered by the number of cases with each arthropod, bees kill the most. Most stings cause mild symptoms and affect men of working age. The incidence decreases during the colder months, which is better noticeable in regions with well-defined seasons. The distribution is distinct among the regions: Southeast, Northeast, and South have the highest rate of bites. The growing number of cases of envenomation reported annually is a serious public health concern, especially involving scorpions, and highlights the importance of studying arthropod venom and improving the therapies."
"Perera Dinidu, Li Linxuan, Walsh Chloe, Silliman Jacob, Xiong Yawei, Wang Qijue, Schniepp Hannes C",Natural spider silk nanofibrils produced by assembling molecules or disassembling fibers.,"Spider silk is biocompatible, biodegradable, and rivals some of the best synthetic materials in terms of strength and toughness. Despite extensive research, comprehensive experimental evidence of the formation and morphology of its internal structure is still limited and controversially discussed. Here, we report the complete mechanical decomposition of natural silk fibers from the golden silk orb-weaver Trichonephila clavipes into ≈10 nm-diameter nanofibrils, the material's apparent fundamental building blocks. Furthermore, we produced nanofibrils of virtually identical morphology by triggering an intrinsic self-assembly mechanism of the silk proteins. Independent physico-chemical fibrillation triggers were revealed, enabling fiber assembly from stored precursors ""at-will"". This knowledge furthers the understanding of this exceptional material's fundamentals, and ultimately, leads toward the realization of silk-based high-performance materials. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Spider silk is one of the strongest and toughest biomaterials, rivaling the best man-made materials. The origins of these traits are still under debate but are mostly attributed to the material's intriguing hierarchical structure. Here we fully disassembled spider silk into 10 nm-diameter nanofibrils for the first time and showed that nanofibrils of the same appearance can be produced via molecular self-assembly of spider silk proteins under certain conditions. This shows that nanofibrils are the key structural elements in silk and leads toward the production of high-performance future materials inspired by spider silk."

Localized right calf pain worsened with walking and was associated with headache, chills, fatigue, and low-grade fevers. A punch biopsy of the anterior right lower leg showed necrotizing neutrophilic vasculitis of superficial and deep vessels. Direct immunofluorescence showed non-specific focal granular deposition of C3 within vessel walls. Three days after presentation, a live spider was found and microscopically identified as a male hobo spider. The patient suspected the spider arrived via packages shipped from Seattle, Washington. The patient was treated with a prednisone taper with full resolution of his cutaneous symptoms. Given the unilaterality of his symptoms and otherwise unexplained etiology, the patient was diagnosed with acute unilateral vasculitis secondary to hobo spider bite. Microscopic examination is required for identification of hobo spiders. Although not deadly, there have been several reports of cutaneous and systemic reactions resulting from hobo spider bites. Our case illustrates the importance of considering hobo spider bites in areas outside of their native regions, as they are known to travel in packaged items."
Melrose James,High Performance Marine and Terrestrial Bioadhesives and the Biomedical Applications They Have Inspired.,"This study has reviewed the naturally occurring bioadhesives produced in marine and freshwater aqueous environments and in the mucinous exudates of some terrestrial animals which have remarkable properties providing adhesion under difficult environmental conditions. These bioadhesives have inspired the development of medical bioadhesives with impressive properties that provide an effective alternative to suturing surgical wounds improving closure and healing of wounds in technically demanding tissues such as the heart, lung and soft tissues like the brain and intestinal mucosa. The Gecko has developed a dry-adhesive system of exceptional performance and has inspired the development of new generation re-usable tapes applicable to many medical procedures. The silk of spider webs has been equally inspiring to structural engineers and materials scientists and has revealed innovative properties which have led to new generation technologies in photonics, phononics and micro-electronics in the development of wearable biosensors. Man made products designed to emulate the performance of these natural bioadhesive molecules are improving wound closure and healing of problematic lesions such as diabetic foot ulcers which are notoriously painful and have also found application in many other areas in biomedicine. Armed with information on the mechanistic properties of these impressive biomolecules major advances are expected in biomedicine, micro-electronics, photonics, materials science, artificial intelligence and robotics technology."

The uniqueness of spider silk resides in its versatility, in which a combination of high strength and extensibility results in extraordinary toughness, superior to almost all natural and man-made fibers. Dragline silk consists of proteins with highly repetitive amino acid sequences, which have been correlated with specific secondary structures responsible for its physical properties. The native fiber also shows high cytocompatibility coupled with low immunogenicity, making it a promising natural biomaterial for numerous biomedical applications. Recently, novel technologies have enabled new insights into the material and biomedical properties of silk.

To determine its diagnostic utility in the setting of liver disease, elastography was utilized on our patient to confirm the clinically suspected diagnosis of cirrhosis. A 59-year-old male presented to our emergency department (ED) with two days of progressive jaundice and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. The patient admitted to drinking > 500 mL of vodka daily for the last seven years, with his last drink on the morning of admission. Physical exam revealed a man in mild acute distress with severe jaundice and an abdomen diffusely tender to palpation. Two spider angiomas were present on the torso along with caput medusae and mild asterixis. Labs revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 408, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 69, prothrombin time (PT) 16.3, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 36, total bilirubin 22.6, and direct bilirubin 19.9 mg/dL. While admitted, total bilirubin rose as high as 31.5 mg/dL. Examination showed a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 22 and a Maddrey score of 37. Ultrasound revealed moderate hepatosplenomegaly with no signs of pancreatitis. Based on the patient's history of alcohol abuse paired with physical exam findings and elevated laboratory markers, we were able to diagnose with a high level of suspicion that this patient was suffering from chronic alcoholic liver disease, exacerbated by an acute episode of alcoholic hepatitis, which led to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was suspected; however, this diagnosis required further confirmation. We utilized ultrasound elastography to measure the velocity of shear wave transmission in the liver of our patient. A literature review was conducted on the use of elastography for the diagnosis of liver disease, and a significant correlation between the velocity of shear wave transmission and hepatic histological findings was identified. Elastography revealed a mean velocity of shear wave transmission of 1.77 m/s in our patient. This finding is consistent with a Meta-analysis of Histological Data in Viral Hepatitis (METAVIR) score of F = 4, indicating significant fibrosis and confirming the suspected diagnosis of alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis. As a non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic tool, elastography demonstrates significant potential for clinical utility in patients with liver disease. Clinicians may benefit from the use of elastography in diagnosis, while patients may receive both therapeutic and prognostic benefits secondary to its use. In similar cases with clinical uncertainty, elastography can reliably identify the presence of fibrous tissue in the liver without tissue biopsy, thus aiding in clinical diagnoses and enabling the use of optimal therapeutic regimens for future patients."

"Kim Yoonjung, Chang Hyunjoon, Yoon Taeyoung, Park Woobum, Choi Hyunsung, Na Sungsoo",Nano-fishnet formation of silk controlled by Arginine density.,"Silk fiber is renowned for its superb mechanical properties, such as over 7 times the toughness of Kevlar 49 Fibre. As the spider silk is tougher than any man-made fiber, there is a lot to be learned from spider silk. Recently, it has been reported that a large portion of the properties of silk is from naturally formed nano-fishnet structures of silk, but neither its formation mechanism nor its formation condition has been explained. Here, we show how the formation and disappearance of nano-fishnet of silk is determined by humidity, and how the humidity-dependency of nano-fishnet formation can be overcome by changing density of Arginine through sequence mutation. We demonstrate that the nano-fishnet-structured silk exhibits higher strength and toughness than its counterparts. This information on controllable nano-fishnet formation of silk is expected to pave the way for development of protein and synthetic fiber design. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Silk fibers are a very interesting material in that it exhibits superb mechanical properties such as 7 times the toughness of Kevlar 49 Fibre, despite being only composed of proteins. Therefore, it is important that we understand the principle of its high mechanical properties so that it may be applied in designing synthetic fibers. Recently, it has been reported that a large portion of its mechanical property comes from its nano-fishnet structures, but no detailed explanation on the condition or mechanism of formation. Through molecular dynamic simulations, we simulated the nano-fishnet formation of silk and analyzed the condition and mechanism behind it, and showed how the formation of nano-fishnet structures could be controlled by changing the density of Arginine residues. Our study provides information on fiber enhancement mechanism that could be applied to synthetic and protein fiber design."

However, some kinds of images that would be relevant in clinical psychology research are not available, especially for small animal phobias. The aim of the present study is to validate a set of animal images that includes images of cockroaches, which are not present in the current sets of images. Two hundred and forty images depicting five types of animals (cockroaches, spiders, snakes, cats, and butterflies) were collected from online public domains. Four hundred and twenty-four participants (72.9% women) took part in the study rating the images in two affective dimensions (i.e., valence and arousal). Cockroach pictures were rated as significantly more unpleasant than pictures of spiders, snakes, butterflies, and cats. Moreover, results revealed that women rated cockroach, spider, and snake pictures as more negative than men did. Also, women in comparison with men rated cockroach images as more arousing. The results highlight the importance of using images of cockroaches, due to their high negative valence, which even exceeds that of snakes and spiders, the unpleasant animals typically used in phobic research. This set of images can be useful in research on small-animal phobias."

"Saric Merisa, Eisoldt Lukas, Döring Volker, Scheibel Thomas",Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics.,"Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co-produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo- and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl-terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self-assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo- and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man-made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high-performance fibers."

Loxoscelism, a condition due to being bitten by Loxosceles spiders, commonly known as recluses, can involve a range of clinical conditions, from local cutaneous lesions to severe systemic involvement. The diagnosis of loxoscelism is usually made by anamnesis and clinical findings. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for patients at high risk of necrotizing fasciitis. Treatment modalities are still controversial and there is no standardized treatment approach. Reported here, our case of loxoscelism involved a 24-year-old man presenting with a Loxosceles spider bite, dermonecrotic lesion, vomiting, diarrhea, acute renal injury, and rhabdomyolysis, who was successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, therapeutic apheresis, hemodialysis, wound debridement, and cutaneous autografting. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach can be life-saving in spider bites that can cause systemic involvement. Loxoscelism should be considered in patients with skin necrosis, acute renal injury, and rhabdomyolysis."
"Peng Ming-Hsiao, Hung Yuan-Chen, Liu Kuan-Ling, Neoh Kok-Boon",Landscape configuration and habitat complexity shape arthropod assemblage in urban parks.,"The urbanization process systematically leads to the loss of biodiversity. Only certain arthropods are resilient to the urbanization process and can thrive in the novel conditions of urbanized landscapes. However, the degree to which arthropod communities survive in urban habitats depends on landscape and local effects and biological interactions (e.g., trophic interactions). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of various factors at landscape (isolation, edge density and area of surrounding greenery) and local (size of park, canopy cover, understory vegetation cover, defoliation depth, weight of dried leaves, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH) spatial scales on the diversity of ants, beetles and spiders in urban parks. Our results indicated that park edge density was negatively correlated with diversity metrics in ants, beetles, and spiders in urban parks relative to the degree of proximity with the peri-urban forest. In other words, parks that located adjacent to the peri-urban forest may not necessarily have high biodiversity. The results suggested that man-made structures have been effective dispersal barriers that limit the spillover effects of ants and spiders but not the spillover of comparatively strong fliers, such as beetles. However, the area of surrounding greenery may have facilitated the colonization of forest-dependent taxa in distant parks. Large parks with reduced edge density supported a higher arthropod diversity because of the minimal edge effect and increased habitat heterogeneity. Vegetation structure consistently explained the variability of ants, beetles, and spiders, indicating that understory plant litter is crucial for providing shelters and hibernation, oviposition, and foraging sites for the major taxa in urban parks. Therefore, efforts should focus on the local management of ground features to maximize the conservation of biological control in urban landscapes."

Kang Changboo,Between Mars and Eros: British Army's Fight Against Venereal Disease during the First World War.,"""Total War"" calls upon combatant countries to mobilize all of their resources and energies for war and their civilians to contribute in their own ways to the ""war effort"" of their respective governments. Carrying out such war, some governments try to redefine the distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere in their people's lives. Even sexual life, the most private sphere in people's lives, may be exposed to various forms of supervision and control from their states in the name of the national ""war effort."" In particular, the government in war does not hesitate to scrutinize the most private sphere of their people's lives when certain aspects of their lives do considerable harm to ""war effort"" or ""national efficiency."" The British society in the First World War intensively experienced some kind of ""social control"" due to the increasing spread of venereal disease (VD) both among civilians and troops. Like British society as a whole, the British army, who had primary responsibility to fight the war in the field, had to fight another hard battle against an enemy within VD, throughout the war. During the First World War, VD caused 416,891 hospital admissions among British and Dominion troops. Excluding readmissions for relapses, approximately five percent of all the men who served in Britain's armies in the course of the war became infected. During the war, at least a division was constantly out of action because so many troops had to treat VD. This disease caused a huge drain on the British army's human and material resources and consequently undermined, to a considerable extent, its military efficiency. However, a series of measures of the British Army to improve the high rate of infection among their troops have been simply considered ineffective by both contemporaries and subsequent researchers. This article aims to provide a more balanced perspective on the efforts of the British Army to fight VD during the war and reconsider the existing understandings in regard to their general effectiveness. It argues that the overall measures of the British Army regarding VD have to be examined in the context of the national efforts of British society to fight against VD as a whole. Their supposed ineffectiveness well-reflected the indecisiveness of the overall British society in terms of both how to view VD and how to fight against it."

However, controlling proton conduction and fabrication of devices exploiting biomaterials remains a challenge. Even more difficult is the design of protein-based bulk materials without any functional starting scaffold for further optimization. Here, we show the rational design of proton-conducting, protein materials exceeding reported proteinaceous systems. The carboxylic acid-rich structures were evolved step by step by exploring various sequences from intrinsically disordered coils over supercharged nanobarrels to hierarchically spider β sheet containing protein-supercharged polypeptide chimeras. The latter material is characterized by interconnected β sheet nanodomains decorated on their surface by carboxylic acid groups, forming self-supportive membranes and allowing for proton conduction in the hydrated state. The membranes showed an extraordinary proton conductivity of 18.5 ± 5 mS/cm at RH = 90%, one magnitude higher than other protein devices. This design paradigm offers great potential for bioprotonic device fabrication interfacing artificial and biological systems."

Cases of myocarditis following a BWS bite are rare but they can be fatal on occasion. However, the prognostic significance of the bite and presentation of myocarditis is unknown. Our case involved a 50-year-old man who presented with myocarditis after being bitten by a BWS and subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit for cardiac monitoring. During the hospital stay, he showed worsening signs on both the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluations despite therapeutic success. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance and coronary angiography investigations showed no significant alterations; blood and instrumental test results slowly improved, and the patient was discharged home after 12 days of hospitalization without complications. This case illustrates that acute myocarditis, although an infrequent complication of BWS bite, has the potential to be lethal. The correct diagnosis, which is not always easy to formulate, is important to identify those patients who can benefit from careful monitoring and specific therapies aimed at reducing the risk of life."
"Cohen Philip R, Skupsky Hadas, Erickson Christof, Calame Antoanella",Foreign Body (Solder) and Reaction to the Foreign Body Presenting As a Cutaneous Tender Tumor: Case Report and a New Acronym to Aid in Recalling the Differential Diagnosis of Painful Skin Lesions.,"Cutaneous tender tumors manifest as painful dermal or subcutaneous masses. Acronyms, a memory aid created from the initial letters of other words, can be used to assist in recalling a list of conditions. We report the case of a man who presented with a painful lesion on his leg; 15 years earlier, hot solder had embedded beneath his skin at that location. The subcutaneous mass was removed, and his symptoms resolved. Microscopic evaluation of the specimen showed a foreign body reaction to metal. Therefore, after correlating his medical history, clinical presentation, and pathology findings, the diagnosis of a foreign body (solder) and a foreign body reaction to solder, as a cause of the patient's painful skin lesion, was established. Including our patient's diagnosis for his painful skin lesion, the list of conditions that have been described as presenting as a cutaneous tender tumor include calcinosis cutis, angioendotheliomatosis, leiomyoma, metastases, hidradenoma, osteoma cutis, glomus tumor, scar, fibromyxoma, leiomyosarcoma, eccrine angiomatous hamartoma, Dercum's disease, piezogenic pedal papule, eccrine spiradenoma, neurilemmoma, something else (such as foreign body (solder) and a reaction to the foreign body), angiolipoma, neuroma, dermatofibroma, granular cell tumor, endometriosis, thrombus, blue rubber bleb nevus, angioma, chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis, and keloid. We introduce a novel acronym for painful lesions of the skin that was inspired by the book Charlotte's Web in which a barn spider (Charlotte), by weaving praises of a pig (Wilbur) into her web, is responsible for the pig's life being spared. Wilbur is a calm pig; however, there was an episode when he temporarily fled his pen and was subsequently induced, with a pail of slop, to get back into the pen. The new acronym for cutaneous tender tumors uses the initial letter of each of the 26 currently established painful skin lesions: CALM HOGS FLED PENS AND GET BACK."

Research in the 21st century has drawn attention to the role of women in culture, society, and technology, and female gaming is one of the growing phenomena not to have been researched in depth. The aim of the present paper was to review female gaming (i.e., the role of females within video game culture) and identify any associated psychopathological symptomatology. The review adapted the Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research (SPIDER) model in conducting a narrative literature review. A search of three scientific electronic databases yielded 49 papers for further evaluation. From a methodological perspective, studies had to fulfill the following criteria to be included: i) published between the years 2000 and 2018; ii) assessed female gaming or the female position within gaming culture, iii) contained quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches to produce empirical data or discuss theoretical implications through reviews, iv) be retrievable as a full-text peer-reviewed journal paper, and v) published in English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or French. Four categories emerged from the papers: i) the benefits of female gaming, ii) why women might play video games less than men, iii) perceptions and realities of female characters within video games, and iv) women's position in gaming culture. The main findings showed playing video games has benefits for women in terms of enhancing cognitive, social, and physical abilities. However, they are less encouraged to play video games due to negative expectations based on gender and/or experiences during game play. Video games are associated with stereotypical male characteristics, such as being overly aggressive, and frequently contain sexualized content. Female gamers appear to require coping strategies to handle online harassment. Females look for different things in video games, which are not often included in game designs thereby limiting their abilities. For instance, female avatar representation-which is exaggerated and hypersexualized-can prompt social comparisons and lead to feelings of decreased self-esteem, depression, and other impacts on well-being. Overall, there are still obstacles for women playing video games even though they comprise half of the gaming population."

"Liu Junjie, Zhu Wenqing, Yu Zhongliang, Wei Xiaoding",Dynamic shear-lag model for understanding the role of matrix in energy dissipation in fiber-reinforced composites.,"Lightweight and high impact performance composite design is a big challenge for scientists and engineers. Inspired from well-known biological materials, e.g., the bones, spider silk, and claws of mantis shrimp, artificial composites have been synthesized for engineering applications. Presently, the design of ballistic resistant composites mainly emphasizes the utilization of light and high-strength fibers, whereas the contribution from matrix materials receives less attention. However, recent ballistic experiments on fiber-reinforced composites challenge our common sense. The use of matrix with ""low-grade"" properties enhances effectively the impact performance. In this study, we establish a dynamic shear-lag model to explore the energy dissipation through viscous matrix materials in fiber-reinforced composites and the associations of energy dissipation characteristics with the properties and geometries of constituents. The model suggests that an enhancement in energy dissipation before the material integrity is lost can be achieved by tuning the shear modulus and viscosity of a matrix. Furthermore, our model implies that an appropriately designed staggered microstructure, adopted by many natural composites, can repeatedly activate the energy dissipation process and thus improve dramatically the impact performance. This model demonstrates the role of matrix in energy dissipation, and stimulates new advanced material design concepts for ballistic applications."

These changes have led to the increased homogenization of island biota and to a high number of extinctions lending support to the recognition of oceanic islands as major threatspots worldwide. Here, we investigate the impact of habitat changes on the spider and ground beetle assemblages of the native forests of Madeira (Madeira archipelago) and Terceira (Azores archipelago) and evaluate its effects on the relative contribution of rare endemics and introduced species to island biodiversity patterns. We found that the native laurel forest of Madeira supported higher species richness of spiders and ground beetles compared with Terceira, including a much larger proportion of indigenous species, particularly endemics. In Terceira, introduced species are well-represented in both terrestrial arthropod taxa and seem to thrive in native forests as shown by the analysis of species abundance distributions (SAD) and occupancy frequency distributions (OFD). Low abundance range-restricted species in Terceira are mostly introduced species dispersing from neighbouring man-made habitats while in Madeira a large number of true rare endemic species can still be found in the native laurel forest. Further, our comparative analysis shows striking differences in species richness and composition that are due to the geographical and geological particularities of the two islands, but also seem to reflect the differences in the severity of human-mediated impacts between them. The high proportion of introduced species, the virtual absence of rare native species and the finding that the SADs and OFDs of introduced species match the pattern of native species in Terceira suggest the role of man as an important driver of species diversity in oceanic islands and add evidence for an extensive and severe human-induced species loss in the native forests of Terceira."

Two of the most widely used measures, the Snake Questionnaire (SNAQ) and Spider Questionnaire (SPQ) are good indicators of specific fears, but researchers have recognised that shorter, yet nevertheless reliable measures are needed. Hence the aims of this research were to develop short forms of the SNAQ and SPQ using item response theory and to use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to determine cut-offs for use in future research. Twelve-item versions of both scales (SNAQ-12 and SPQ-12) demonstrated excellent discrimination along the latent continuum in a sample of 1354 people. The SNAQ-12 and SPQ-12 showed excellent reliability and were highly correlated with the corresponding full-length scale. The scales discriminated between participants who reported snake (3.25%) or spider (8.05%) phobia and those who did not. Further analyses revealed that non-phobic women report higher fear of both snakes and spiders than do men, but this difference was not present in phobics. These findings suggest that the SNAQ-12 and SPQ-12 have considerable strengths, including shorter assessment and scoring times, whilst retaining high reliability and potential utility as a clinical screening tool."

The present investigation examined the psychometric properties of the Hungarian version of two commonly used measures of fear: the Spider Phobia Questionnaire (i.e. SPQ) and the Snake Questionnaire (i.e. SNAQ). The SPQ and SNAQ scores both demonstrated excellent reliability, including a test-retest over a 4-week period. Supportive evidence for the validity of the SPQ and SNAQ scores was found using questions assessing fainting and avoidance history, regarding snakes and spiders, based on DSM-V criteria. Both questionnaires could discriminate between participants who reported such an event and those who did not. Further analyses also revealed a sex difference, with women scoring higher than men on both scales. Moreover, 9.5% and 4.24% of the respondents reached the cut-off point, set by previous studies, for spider and snake phobias, respectively. These findings suggest that the SPQ and SNAQ have excellent psychometric properties, making them suitable for use in further cross-cultural research and epidemiological studies."

Despite a broad experimental foundation concerning the macroscopic silk thread properties as well as a thorough simulation-based molecular understanding, the impact of the mesoscale building blocks, namely nano-/submicrometer-sized filaments, on the mechanical properties of the threads remains the missing link. Here, we illustrate the function of these mesoscaled building blocks using electrospun fibers made of a recombinant spider silk protein and show the impact of β-sheet content and fiber hydration on their mechanical performance. Specifically elucidating the interplay between β-sheet-cross-linking (fiber strength) and structural water (fiber extensibility), the results bridge the gap between the molecular and the macroscopic view on the mechanics of spider silk. It is demonstrated that the extensibility of the here used single (MaSp2-like) protein system is in good accordance with the simulated extensibilities published by other groups. Furthermore, sufficient hydration of the fibers is shown to be a prerequisite to obtain a toughness in the range of that of natural dragline silk. Preliminary studies on electrospun fibers of the MaSp2-based recombinant spider silk proteins used in this work have indicated their basic applicability in the technical field of filter systems as well as in regenerative medicine. The presented work provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanical performance of such fibers under different wetting conditions, a prerequisite to further specify their potential for such applications."

"Barroso da Silva Fernando Luís, Pasquali Samuela, Derreumaux Philippe, Dias Luis Gustavo",Electrostatics analysis of the mutational and pH effects of the N-terminal domain self-association of the major ampullate spidroin.,"Spider silk is a fascinating material combining mechanical properties such as maximum strength and high toughness comparable or better than man-made materials, with biocompatible degradability characteristics. Experimental measurements have shown that pH triggers the dimer formation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp 1). A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data. Our results can contribute to the design of new mutants with specific association properties."
"Omer Mohamed A, Laster Steven B, Amin Amit, Main Michael L",Contrast-Enhanced Echocardiographic Evaluation of a Giant Saphenous Vein Graft Aneurysm.,"A 61-year-old man presented with unstable angina 16 years after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and a sequential saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right coronary artery and an obtuse marginal branch. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with a Philips iE33 machine and an S5 transducer revealed a 5.3 cm × 4.6 cm mass with a central echolucent area, surrounded by a peripheral zone of increased echodensity adjacent to, and partially compressing, the right atrium. Contrast echocardiography following an intravenous bolus injection of Definity revealed late appearance of contrast within the mass consistent with a giant SVG aneurysm. Coronary artery bypass graft angiography revealed a giant aneurysm in the SVG proximal to the RCA anastomosis; the distal limb of the graft to the obtuse marginal branch was occluded. Under intravascular ultrasound guidance, a 7-mm spider filter was placed in the distal graft; then, a 6 mm × 10 cm Viabahn self-expanding nitinol polyethylene terephthalate-covered stent was deployed in the SVG with good seal zones proximally and distally. A follow-up contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiogram 1 day postprocedure revealed partial thrombosis of the aneurysm cavity. Ultrasound contrast did not appear in the aneurysm following intravenous injection, consistent with complete exclusion from the systemic circulation. This is the first report demonstrating feasibility of contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of SVG aneurysm and confirming procedural success by documenting exclusion from the systemic circulation following intervention."
"Pouraghaei Mahboob, Shams Vahdati Samad, Mashhadi Ibrahim, Mahmoudieh Taranoom",Periumbilical Pain with Radiation to Both Legs Following Tarantula Bite; a Case Report.,"Tarantulas have recently become as pets in most parts of the world that increased the probability of encountering emergency physicians with patients hurt with these spiders. Their attacks usually do not cause general manifestation, however there are some case reports in this regard. Here, a 40-year-old man was reported who was referred to the emergency department with severe periumbilical pain that radiated to both legs and diagnosed as a victim of tarantula bite. Such symptoms usually are belonging to other spiders like Black Widow spider, but it seems that tarantula can mimic them in some cases, too."
"Doblhofer Elena, Heidebrecht Aniela, Scheibel Thomas",To spin or not to spin: spider silk fibers and more.,"Spider silk fibers have a sophisticated hierarchical structure composed of proteins with highly repetitive sequences. Their extraordinary mechanical properties, defined by a unique combination of strength and extensibility, are superior to most man-made fibers. Therefore, spider silk has fascinated mankind for thousands of years. However, due to their aggressive territorial behavior, farming of spiders is not feasible on a large scale. For this reason, biotechnological approaches were recently developed for the production of recombinant spider silk proteins. These recombinant proteins can be assembled into a variety of morphologies with a great range of properties for technical and medical applications. Here, the different approaches of biotechnological production and the advances in material processing toward various applications will be reviewed."
"Bush Sean P, Davy J Veeran",Troponin elevation after black widow spider envenomation.,"Black widow spider envenomation generally results in self-limiting pain that can be treated in the emergency department (ED) with analgesics and benzodiazepines, usually with no further intervention. Occasionally, a patient has to be admitted or treated with antivenom for refractory pain or a venom-induced complication. We present the case of an 84-year-old man who presented to our ED with chest pain and dyspnea after being bitten on the foot by a western black widow spider (Lactrodectus hesperus). His initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was elevated at 0.07 ng/ml and continued to rise to a peak of 0.17 ng/ml. He also had rhabdomyolysis, another uncommon complication of black widow envenomation. An elevated cTnI generally signifies myocardial injury and is rarely seen after black widow envenomation. We discuss the possible etiologies for an elevated cardiac biomarker, in this context, and review potentially serious complications of widow spider envenomation presenting with chest symptoms and an elevated cardiac biomarker."
"Burfeind Sean M, Chimera Nicole",Randomized Control Trial Investigating the Effects of Kinesiology Tape on Shoulder Proprioception.,"Athletes participating in upper-extremity-dominant sports such as softball and volleyball are at increased risk for glenohumeral-joint pain and injury. For these athletes, an integral part of many injury-prevention and -rehabilitation programs includes improving joint proprioception. One way to measure joint proprioception is through the reproduction of joint angles, or joint-reposition sense (JRS). Kinesiology tape is purported to enhance neuromuscular feedback; therefore, it may influence JRS. However, conflicting findings and the lack of research in the upper extremity warrant further investigation."
"Gawrońska H, Bakera B",Phytoremediation of particulate matter from indoor air by ,"Higher plants, including spider plants, are able to take up and degrade/detoxify various pollutants in the air. Although nearly 120 plant species have been tested for indoor air phytoremediation, to the best of the authors' knowledge, data on particulate matter (PM) phytoremediation from indoor air are not yet available in literature. This work determined the ability of spider plants to take up PM, one of the most harmful pollutants to man, in the indoor air of five rooms housing different activities (a dental clinic, a perfume-bottling room, a suburban house, an apartment and an office). It was found that spider plants accumulate PM of both categories (water washable and trapped in waxes) and in all three size fractions determined and that the amount differed depending on the type of activity taking place in the particular rooms ranging from 13.62 to 19.79 μg/cm"
"Guéguen Nicolas, Silone Fabien, David Mathieu, Pascual Alexandre","THE EFFECT OF THE ""EVOKING FREEDOM"" TECHNIQUE ON AN UNUSUAL AND DISTURBING REQUEST.","The ""evoking freedom"" technique consists in soliciting someone to comply with a request by simply saying that she is free to accept or to refuse the request. However, previous studies used low cost requests. The present study examined the magnitude of this technique associated with a more disturbing and costly request. Sixty men and 60 women aged approximately 20-25 years walking in the street were asked by a male confederate to hold a closed transparent box containing a live trap-door spider while he went into the post office to pick up a package. In the evoking freedom condition, the confederate added in his request that the participant was ""free to accept or to refuse."" More compliance occurred in the ""evoking freedom"" condition (53.3%) than in the control condition (36.7%). These results confirm the robustness and the magnitude of the evoking freedom technique on compliance and show that this technique remained effective even when the request was psychologically costly to perform and was associated with fear."

"Barber Asa H, Lu Dun, Pugno Nicola M",Extreme strength observed in limpet teeth.,"The teeth of limpets exploit distinctive composite nanostructures consisting of high volume fractions of reinforcing goethite nanofibres within a softer protein phase to provide mechanical integrity when rasping over rock surfaces during feeding. The tensile strength of discrete volumes of limpet tooth material measured using in situ atomic force microscopy was found to range from 3.0 to 6.5 GPa and was independent of sample size. These observations highlight an absolute material tensile strength that is the highest recorded for a biological material, outperforming the high strength of spider silk currently considered to be the strongest natural material, and approaching values comparable to those of the strongest man-made fibres. This considerable tensile strength of limpet teeth is attributed to a high mineral volume fraction of reinforcing goethite nanofibres with diameters below a defect-controlled critical size, suggesting that natural design in limpet teeth is optimized towards theoretical strength limits."
"Sulikowski Danielle, Burke Darren",Threat is in the sex of the beholder: men find weapons faster than do women.,"In visual displays, people locate potentially threatening stimuli, such as snakes, spiders, and weapons, more quickly than similar benign stimuli, such as beetles and gadgets. Such biases are likely adaptive, facilitating fast responses to potential threats. Currently, and historically, men have engaged in more weapons-related activities (fighting and hunting) than women. If biases of visual attention for weapons result from selection pressures related to these activities, then we would predict such biases to be stronger in men than in women. The current study reports the results of two visual search experiments, in which men showed a stronger bias of attention toward guns and knives than did women, whether the weapons were depicted wielded or not. When the weapons were depicted wielded, both sexes searched for them with more caution than when they were not. Neither of these effects extended reliably to syringes, a non-weapon-yet potentially threatening-object. The findings are discussed with respect to the ""weapons effect"" and social coercion theory."
"Van Strien Jan W, Franken Ingmar H A, Huijding Jorg","Testing the snake-detection hypothesis: larger early posterior negativity in humans to pictures of snakes than to pictures of other reptiles, spiders and slugs.","According to the snake detection hypothesis (Isbell, 2006), fear specifically of snakes may have pushed evolutionary changes in the primate visual system allowing pre-attentional visual detection of fearful stimuli. A previous study demonstrated that snake pictures, when compared to spiders or bird pictures, draw more early attention as reflected by larger early posterior negativity (EPN). Here we report two studies that further tested the snake detection hypothesis. In Study 1, we tested whether the enlarged EPN is specific for snakes or also generalizes to other reptiles. Twenty-four healthy, non-phobic women watched the random rapid serial presentation of snake, crocodile, and turtle pictures. The EPN was scored as the mean activity at occipital electrodes (PO3, O1, Oz, PO4, O2) in the 225-300 ms time window after picture onset. The EPN was significantly larger for snake pictures than for pictures of the other reptiles. In Study 2, we tested whether disgust plays a role in the modulation of the EPN and whether preferential processing of snakes also can be found in men. 12 men and 12 women watched snake, spider, and slug pictures. Both men and women exhibited the largest EPN amplitudes to snake pictures, intermediate amplitudes to spider pictures and the smallest amplitudes to slug pictures. Disgust ratings were not associated with EPN amplitudes. The results replicate previous findings and suggest that ancestral priorities modulate the early capture of visual attention."
Madea Burkhard,[Cranial CT as basis for reconstruction of events and identification of a weapon].,"Radiological findings, especially CT scans, are of great importance in the reconstruction of events and may also be helpful to identify the weapon used. This is illustrated by a briefly survived craniocerebral trauma whose origin was controversially discussed. A 51-year-old man had suffered a severe craniocerebral trauma in a robbery. The CT scans revealed fractures of the left parietal region, among them a spider's web fracture, on the cause of which opinions differed (fall or blow). It was also unclear which of the three confiscated objects (empty wine bottle, bending iron, wooden hammer) was used for the assault. Evaluation of the CT findings showed that at least two blows had obviously been inflicted to the cranial skull. Apart from several injuries of the scalp due to blows, the typical combination of findings in the occipital region and contre-coup lesions suggested that the head had also hit the ground due to a fall. The soft tissue injuries may have been caused by all the three confiscated objects. The bony injuries were most probably caused by the bending iron, whereas the wooden hammer and the wine bottle could be ruled out as the causative weapon or were at least highly improbable."

"Lim Kok Haw Jonathan, Howard Mark, Jackson Neil, Verma Sumita",Older men with unexplained hepatitis.,"A 59-year-old Caucasian man presented with painless jaundice for 6 weeks. He drank 70 units of alcohol per week. Examination revealed jaundice, spider angiomata and a 3 cm firm hepatomegaly. Initial bloods: bilirubin 152 µmol/L, alanine aminotransferase 1484 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 130 IU/L, γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase 1224 IU/L and International Normalised Ratio 1.1. A standard liver screen was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound/CT scan suggested cirrhosis, confirmed by liver biopsy on day 5. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) serology on day 6 indicated acute infection. He developed severe hepatic decompensation characterised by worsening jaundice, ascites and variceal bleeding. On day 33 ribavirin 600 mg was initiated though discontinued after 2 weeks on receipt of a negative HEV RNA. At the last follow-up he had recovered, and remains abstinent from alcohol. We describe a case of autochthonously (locally) acquired HEV infection with life-threatening hepatic decompensation in the presence of undiagnosed alcohol-related cirrhosis."
"Kelly D J, White C, Richardson G",Noninfarct related artery embolic protection during primary PCI.,A 66-year old man presented with antero-lateral STEMI. An ulcerated plaque and thrombus were seen in the proximal LAD. We were unable to pass a thrombectomy catheter down the LAD. To avoid embolisation of debris a Spider FX distal protection device was placed into the circumflex artery. Following stent implantation the patient developed chest pain with inferolateral ST depression. Thrombus was extracted from the circumflex artery within the distal protection device. Noninfract related artery distal protection during primary PCI may be an appropriate safeguard where thrombectomy is not possible in an infarct-related left coronary branch.

Forty-seven percent of patients with end-stage liver disease may have hepatopulmonary syndrome, an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Gross dilatation of pulmonary precapillary and capillary vessels, as well as an absolute increase in the number of dilated vessels, is the classic pathological description. We report a young man with cirrhosis demonstrating extrapulmonary shunting of 99mTc-MAA to kidneys with extensive peripheral arteriovenous (cutaneous) vasodilation, which we prefer to name as the ""mosaic sign"" in the absence of spider nevi or erythema."

"Topping Christopher John, Kjaer Lene Jung, Hommen Udo, Høye Toke Thomas, Preuss Thomas G, Sibly Richard M, van Vliet Peter",Recovery based on plot experiments is a poor predictor of landscape-level population impacts of agricultural pesticides.,"Current European Union regulatory risk assessment allows application of pesticides provided that recovery of nontarget arthropods in-crop occurs within a year. Despite the long-established theory of source-sink dynamics, risk assessment ignores depletion of surrounding populations and typical field trials are restricted to plot-scale experiments. In the present study, the authors used agent-based modeling of 2 contrasting invertebrates, a spider and a beetle, to assess how the area of pesticide application and environmental half-life affect the assessment of recovery at the plot scale and impact the population at the landscape scale. Small-scale plot experiments were simulated for pesticides with different application rates and environmental half-lives. The same pesticides were then evaluated at the landscape scale (10 km × 10 km) assuming continuous year-on-year usage. The authors' results show that recovery time estimated from plot experiments is a poor indicator of long-term population impact at the landscape level and that the spatial scale of pesticide application strongly determines population-level impact. This raises serious doubts as to the utility of plot-recovery experiments in pesticide regulatory risk assessment for population-level protection. Predictions from the model are supported by empirical evidence from a series of studies carried out in the decade starting in 1988. The issues raised then can now be addressed using simulation. Prediction of impacts at landscape scales should be more widely used in assessing the risks posed by environmental stressors."
"Lopes Priscila Hess, Bertani Rogério, Gonçalves-de-Andrade Rute M, Nagahama Roberto H, van den Berg Carmen W, Tambourgi Denise V","Venom of the Brazilian spider Sicarius ornatus (Araneae, Sicariidae) contains active sphingomyelinase D: potential for toxicity after envenomation.","The spider family Sicariidae includes two genera, Sicarius and Loxosceles. Bites by Sicarius are uncommon in humans and, in Brazil, a single report is known of a 17-year old man bitten by a Sicarius species that developed a necrotic lesion similar to that caused by Loxosceles. Envenomation by Loxosceles spiders can result in dermonecrosis and severe ulceration. Sicarius and Loxosceles spider venoms share a common characteristic, i.e., the presence of Sphingomyelinases D (SMase D). We have previously shown that Loxosceles SMase D is the enzyme responsible for the main pathological effects of the venom. Recently, it was demonstrated that Sicarius species from Africa, like Loxosceles spiders from the Americas, present high venom SMase D activity. However, despite the presence of SMase D like proteins in venoms of several New World Sicarius species, they had reduced or no detectable SMase D activity. In order to contribute to a better understanding about the toxicity of New World Sicarius venoms, the aim of this study was to characterize the toxic properties of male and female venoms from the Brazilian Sicarius ornatus spider and compare these with venoms from Loxosceles species of medical importance in Brazil."
"Baatiema Leonard, Skovdal Morten, Rifkin Susan, Campbell Catherine",Assessing participation in a community-based health planning and services programme in Ghana.,Community participation is increasingly seen as a pre-requisite for successful health service uptake. It is notoriously difficult to assess participation and little has been done to advance tools for the assessment of community participation.

"Lenci Stefano, Rega Giuseppe, Ruzziconi Laura",The dynamical integrity concept for interpreting/ predicting experimental behaviour: from macro- to nano-mechanics.,"The dynamical integrity, a new concept proposed by J.M.T. Thompson, and developed by the authors, is used to interpret experimental results. After reviewing the main issues involved in this analysis, including the proposal of a new integrity measure able to capture in an easy way the safe part of basins, attention is dedicated to two experiments, a rotating pendulum and a micro-electro-mechanical system, where the theoretical predictions are not fulfilled. These mechanical systems, the former at the macro-scale and the latter at the micro-scale, permit a comparative analysis of different mechanical and dynamical behaviours. The fact that in both cases the dynamical integrity permits one to justify the difference between experimental and theoretical results, which is the main achievement of this paper, shows the effectiveness of this new approach and suggests its use in practical situations. The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes the middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested. Therefore, from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never been made), much may be hoped. (Francis Bacon 1561-1626) But are we sure of our observational facts? Scientific men are rather fond of saying pontifically that one ought to be quite sure of one's observational facts before embarking on theory. Fortunately those who give this advice do not practice what they preach. Observation and theory get on best when they are mixed together, both helping one another in the pursuit of truth. It is a good rule not to put overmuch confidence in a theory until it has been confirmed by observation. I hope I shall not shock the experimental physicists too much if I add that it is also a good rule not to put overmuch confidence in the observational results that are put forward until they have been confirmed by theory.

"Wainwright Dylan K, Kleinteich Thomas, Kleinteich Anja, Gorb Stanislav N, Summers Adam P",Stick tight: suction adhesion on irregular surfaces in the northern clingfish.,"The northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus, is able to adhere to slippery, fouled and irregular surfaces in the marine intertidal environment. We have found that the fish can adhere equally well to surfaces with a broad range of surface roughness, from the finest sandpaper (R(a) = 15 µm) to textures suitable for removing finish from flooring (R(a) = 269 µm). The fishes outperform man-made suction cups, which only adhere to the smoothest surfaces. The adhesive forces of clingfish correspond to pressures 0.2-0.5 atm below ambient and are 80-230 times the body weight of the fish. The tenacity appears related to hierarchically structured microvilli around the edges of the adhesive disc that are similar in size and aspect ratio to the setae found on the feet of geckoes, spiders and insects. This points to a possible biomimetic solution to the problem of reversibly adhering to irregular, submerged surfaces."
